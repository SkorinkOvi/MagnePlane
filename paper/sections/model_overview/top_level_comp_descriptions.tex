\subsubsection{Mission}
	It is necessary to obtain a reasonable estimation of the mission
	performance requirements in order to carry out system level trade studies.
	It is important to note that the exact mission route is dependent on the
	topography of the land between the two notional endpoints. Currently, it is
	beyond the scope of the model to account for the effect that varying
	topology will have on the podâ€™s trajectory. For simplicity, the model
	assumes that the pod travels in a straight, flat line between the departure
	and arrival locations, in this case between Los Angeles (LAX) and San
	Francisco (SFO) International airports.
	The mission velocity profile contains three phases: acceleration, coasting
	with periodic boosting, and deceleration.
	\begin{figure}

	\end{figure}
	\Cref{fig:mission_profile} shows a notional velocity profile using the
	mission analysis model. The initial acceleration is
	modeled as a constant linear acceleration of 1g from rest to top speed.
	Previous analyses have modeled the start up as an incremental acceleration,
	as is shown in \cref{fig:mission_profile}, to allow for more maneuverability
	near departure and arrival points, and to avoid sustaining potentially
	uncomfortable g forces for prolonged periods of time \cite{Chin}.
	The difference in energy consumption between an incremental acceleration
	and the constant acceleration used in this model is negligible.
	The second phase of travel consists of a coasting pod with periodic boosting sections.
	In this phase, the pod begins at top speed and is allowed to coast until it
	reaches some minimum allowable speed set by the user.
	Then, the pod will enter an electromagnetic boosting section which will
	accelerate the pod at 1g back to the desired top speed.
	For straight and level travel, the acceleration of the pod is given by the equation
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:acceleration}
		\frac{\mathrm{d} v}{\mathrm{d} t} = f ( v  ) = \frac{1}{m} ( F_{thrust} - \frac{1}{2}C_{D}\rho V^{2}A - D_{mag})
	\end{equation}
	where $F_{thrust}$ is the net thrust generated by the flow through the pod
	nozzle, $C_D$ is the pod drag coefficient, $\rho$ is the free stream air
	density, $A$ is the pod planform area, and $D_{mag}$ is the drag produced
	by the magnetic levitation system. The acceleration equation is integrated
	to find the time and distance it takes for the pod to decelerate to the
	minimum allowable speed using a predictor-corrector integration method.

  The coast distance is used to determine the number of propulsive sections
	needed along the track to complete the mission. The energy consumed in a
	single propulsive section is then multiplied by the number of propulsive
	sections along the track to determine the electromagnetic propulsive energy
	consumed per flight during the coasting phase of the mission. The final
	phase of the mission is a constant linear deceleration of 0.5g from top
	speed to rest. Many systems driven by electromagnetic propulsion conserve
	energy through regenerative braking \cite{inductrack}. For the sake of
	conservatism, it is assumed that there is no regenerative braking in this
	process, although the model allows for regenerative braking to be
	accounted for if the user desires. The energy consumed per flight is
	computed by adding the consumption of all three phases.

\subsubsection{Cost}
	The cost module estimates the cost of energy, materials, pods, and
	construction capital. The cost of construction is highly subjective and it
	is difficult to get an accurate estimation within less than an order of
	magnitude of uncertainty. However, the cost of materials and energy
	consumption can be estimated with significantly greater certainty.
	Thus, in this analysis, the cost estimations of materials and energy are of greater interest.
	The average price of electricity used in the model is 0.13 USD/kWh, based on
	data from the Electricity Information Administration\cite{EIA}.
	Using a different value will not significantly change the trends in the trade studies this model produces.
	A rough estimation of the ticket cost is included, which projects ticket cost based on the equation
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:ticket_cost}
    \text{Cost}_\text{ticket} = \frac{ (\frac{\partial \text{Cost}}{\partial D}D+\frac{\partial \text{Cost} }{\partial \text{pod}}n_{\text{pods}}+\text{Cost}_\text{capital} ( 1+ib ) + \frac{\partial \text{Cost}}{\partial \mathcal{E}} (\mathcal{E}_\text{tube} + \mathcal{E}_\text{pod}  ))  )}{n_\text{passengers}*\frac{\text{pods}}{s}*3600\frac{s}{\text{\text{year}}}*24\frac{\text{\text{year}}}{\text{day}}*365\frac{\text{day}}{\text{year}}*bm}
	\end{equation}
	Where $ib$ is the bond interest rate, $bm$ is the number of years for bond
	maturity, and $D$ is the total length of the track. Previous research
	indicated that construction costs are likely to be the largest cost factor
	in the system \cite{Musk}. Due to the lack of a reliable method of
	estimating construction cost or ticket markup at this stage of the design process,
	the exact values of the ticket cost produced by this model will have a high level of uncertainty.
	However, the trade studies conducted in these analyses can provide useful
	information to inform the development of more accurate ticket cost models in the future.
